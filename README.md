# Furcellaria-lumbricalis-population-genomics
In this study, we compare attached and free-drifting forms of the perennial red algae Furcellaria lumbricalis, to investigate their reproductive mode, stability and population structure. Samples were collected from four sites and sequencing was performed using 2bRAD sequencing.
