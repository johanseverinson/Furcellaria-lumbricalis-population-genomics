Scrits and data to accompany the manuscript "Drifting Furcellaria lumbricalis Exhibits Genetic Differentiation and Increased Clonality Compared to Attached Conspecifics" by Severinson, J., Moksnes, P-O. and Jahnke, M.

In this study, we compare attached and free-drifting forms of the perennial red algae Furcellaria lumbricalis, to investigate their reproductive mode, stability and population structure. Samples were collected from four sites and sequencing was performed using 2bRAD sequencing.

Fasta files and sample information can be found at NCBI BioProject: PRJNA1387154. The naming convention for fasta files are: site-FL-type-number, where sites are Askö (A), Kalvöfjorden (K), Nordön (N) and Ryskärsfjorden (R), while types are attached to hard substrate (A) and drifting on soft bottom sediments (M and T). For example, an attached sample from Askö is called A-FL-A-5. You will see this naming convention also used throughout scripts (as opposed to the naming in the manuscript).
